Hello,

This project offers a machine learning template designed to perform data analysis and prediction tasks using various models. Unlike its previous version, this update is refactored using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Project Overview
This template provides the following key functionalities:

Data Loading and Processing: Includes functions for reading data files, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and preparing datasets for analysis.

Visualization: Provides tools for visual analysis of data through line plots, histograms, and other visualizations.

Feature Engineering: Allows users to create new features from existing datasets.

Data Cleaning: Supports removal of unnecessary columns and management of missing values.

Model Training and Evaluation: Facilitates training of multiple machine learning models and evaluates their performance.

GitHub Integration: Easy integration to upload your project to GitHub for collaboration and sharing.

Usage
Users can utilize this template to load, process, train models on their datasets, and evaluate their results. It's designed for customization and extension to fit various data science projects.

Uploading to GitHub
By uploading your project to GitHub using this template, you can share and collaborate with a wider community of data scientists and developers, contributing to open-source projects in data science.

I hope this template proves valuable for your data science endeavors.
